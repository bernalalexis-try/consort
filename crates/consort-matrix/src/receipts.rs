//! Saying what has been read, and counting what has not.
//!
//! Two halves of one subject. A receipt is what this account tells the
//! homeserver it has seen; an unread count is what the homeserver and the SDK
//! make of that afterwards. Neither works without the other: without a receipt
//! every room is unread forever, and without a count a receipt is a courtesy to
//! other people's clients and nothing this one draws.
//!
//! ## Two receipts and a marker
//!
//! [`mark_read`] sends up to three things in one request, and they are not the
//! same thing said three ways.
//!
//! `m.read` is public. Everybody in the room can see it, which is how a client
//! draws the little faces beside a message, and there is no way to unsend one.
//! `m.read.private` is the same claim made to the homeserver alone: it resets
//! the unread counts and tells nobody. Which of the two goes out is a setting,
//! because it is a decision about being watched rather than a technical one,
//! and `app/src-tauri/src/settings.rs` is where the answer is kept.
//!
//! `m.fully_read` is neither. It is room account data rather than a receipt,
//! it is always private, and it is the one this build draws: it is what the
//! line across a conversation saying "you stopped here" is read from. It goes
//! out on every call whichever receipt accompanies it.
//!
//! ## Where the counts come from
//!
//! [`count_unread`] subscribes matrix-sdk's event cache, and until it is
//! called `Room::num_unread_messages` and `Room::num_unread_mentions` answer
//! zero for every room on the account, forever. They are not read off the
//! homeserver's own tally: the server cannot see inside an encrypted message,
//! so it can neither tell a message from a reaction nor find a mention, and
//! every room Consort cares about is encrypted. The SDK counts client-side
//! instead, from the events it has cached and the account's push rules, and
//! the event cache is the thing that holds those events.
//!
//! What that costs is one more consumer of the sync updates this client
//! already publishes, and the event store the sqlite configuration already
//! opens. What it does not cost is a second sync: the cache reads
//! `subscribe_to_all_room_updates`, which is the same broadcast
//! [`crate::rooms::watch`] and [`crate::timeline::watch`] are already on.
